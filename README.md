# Login-Page-Animation
The GitHub login page animation is designed to provide an attractive and user-friendly login experience for users accessing the platform.
 It combines aesthetics with functionality to create a memorable first impression for both new and returning users.

Key Elements:

Background Animation:
The animation begins with a dynamic background featuring a subtle, slow-moving, abstract pattern inspired by GitHub's Octocat logo. This background serves as an eye-catching visual element, setting the tone for the login page.
Logo Transition:
GitHub's logo, the Octocat, subtly transitions onto the screen, starting as a faint outline and gradually filling in its details. This gradual reveal adds an element of intrigue and anticipation.
Username and Password Fields:
The login form fields (username/email and password) appear smoothly from the center of the screen as the Octocat logo finishes its transition. These fields are sleek and minimalist, in line with GitHub's design philosophy.
Interactive Elements:
As users hover over the input fields, they subtly highlight with a color change effect to indicate interactivity. Placeholder text inside the fields fades away when users begin typing.
